# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-apple-
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It explores the use of both custom-built CNN architectures and pre-trained models like VGG16 to classify images into different categories. The project is part of a machine learning and pattern recognition module.
