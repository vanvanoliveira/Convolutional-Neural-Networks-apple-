# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-apple-

Overview

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It explores the use of both custom-built CNN architectures and pre-trained models like VGG16 to classify images into different categories. The project is part of a machine learning and pattern recognition module and is developed using TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Key Components:
Data Import and Preprocessing:

The dataset for training and testing is stored on Google Drive and imported into Google Colab.
The project uses ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, enhancing the model's ability to generalize by generating new training samples through transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming.
Model Architecture:

A custom CNN model is built using several convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers. Dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting.
Additionally, a pre-trained VGG16 model is fine-tuned for the specific image classification task to compare its performance with the custom model.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The models are trained on the dataset with metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score tracked to evaluate performance.
A confusion matrix and classification report are generated to provide detailed insights into the models' performance.
Results and Analysis:

A comparison of the custom-built model and the fine-tuned VGG16 model is conducted, focusing on accuracy, loss, and other performance metrics.
Visualization of training and validation losses/accuracies is provided to understand model convergence and generalization ability.
Libraries and Tools Used:
Python: The project uses Python for model development and evaluation.
TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training neural networks.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the training process and model performance.
Scikit-learn: For generating confusion matrices and classification reports.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effective application of CNNs in image classification tasks, comparing a custom-built model with a pre-trained network to highlight their respective strengths and weaknesses. The use of data augmentation and transfer learning showcases advanced techniques in building robust and efficient machine learning models.
